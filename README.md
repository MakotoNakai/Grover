# Grover

## The problem this algorithm is trying to aim.  

This algorithm can search the desired choice among unorganized database.

## Process to achive the goal.

### 1.Create the superposition.  

The first thing you have to do is to put hadamard gates on all the qubits.  In this repository, I prepared 2 qubits. 
So, I got 4 choices.
